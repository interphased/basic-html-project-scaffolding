# Basic HTML Project Scaffolding
Basic HTML project scaffolding with Gulp, Bower, &amp; LESS.

## Overview
This project helps speed up the process of setting up a simple HTML project. It creates a maintainable directory structure in addition to configuring Gulp and Bower - and that's basically it. The project is intentionally bare so you can do whatever you want. By default it uses LESS but you can easily replace it with SASS, Stylus, etc...
